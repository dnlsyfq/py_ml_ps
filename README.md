### Supervised 
* Learn from label

### Unsupervised 
* Learn from pattern

### Traditional ML Models

* Regression models
    * Linear
    * Lasso
    * Ridge
    * SVR

* Classification models
    * Naive Bayes
    * SVM
    * Decision Trees
    * Random Forest

* Dimensionality Reduction
    * Manifold Learning
    * Factor Analysis

* Clustering
    * K-means
    * DBSCAN
    * Spectral clustering

### Model parameters 

### ML models

* Build a tree structure to classify
* Fit line or curve on data 
* Apply probabilities on input to get output probabilities

### Traditional vs Deep Learning Models

|Traditional ML Models|Deep Learning ML Models|
|---|---|
|Features used in models explicitly chosen by domain experts|Features used in models implicitly chosen by model itself|
|Structured data such as numbers and probabilities|Unstructured data usch as images and movies|
|Wide range of problem-specific solution techniques|Neural networks by far the most common solution technique|
|Each solution technique adopts characteristics approach|All solution techniques rely on neurons and interconnections between them|User has more insight into mechanics and internal of models| Black-bo models that are hard to question or reverse-engineer|
|scikit-learn|Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch|

### Data Generation

* Swiss Rolls
* S-curves

### Training ML 

> Supervised
Feedback - loss function or cost function 
y variables -
    * categorical (classification)
    * continuous (regression)


> Unsupervised
Does not have y variables , a labeled corpus
 find pattern in underlying data

 * ML Algorithms
    * Clustering
    * Dimensionality Reduction
